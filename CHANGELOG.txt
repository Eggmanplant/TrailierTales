# Minecraft: Java Edition - Trailier Tales
After the Wilder Update controversy passed, Trails & Tales came along and effectively accomplished the same thing. Although it didn't overpromise, it felt as though it had under-delivered on the content side of things.
We're back once again to hopefully remedy this, with Trailier Tales!
