# Minecraft: Java Edition - Trailier Tales
After the Wilder Update controversy passed, Trails & Tales came along and effectively accomplished the same thing. Although it didn't overpromise, it felt as though it had under-delivered on the content side of things.
We're back once again to hopefully remedy this, with Trailier Tales!

**DISCLAIMER**
Do not use this mod in attempt to harass Mojang. They are hard workers and know what's best for their game- we're simply adding and changing features as we see fit.
